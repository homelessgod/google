Please reset your password. If you use the same username and password for any other accounts, please reset your password there as well.\n\nPassword Check-Up was built with privacy in mind. It never reports any identifying information about your accounts, passwords or device. We do report anonymous information about the number of look-ups that surface an unsafe credential, whether an alert leads to a password change, and the domain involved for improving site coverage.
